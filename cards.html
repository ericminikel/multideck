          The Multideck includes a regular 52-card, four-color, four-pip
          set of playing cards (great for Poker and for southpaws), but you can
          also use the extra cards and markings to play some of of my favorite
          games. Here are some instructions from Adam:

            <em>To play Tichu, add four extra cards: Dragon, Phoenix, Dog, and 1 (Mah Jong). Discard the Wizards.</em><br/>
            <p>
              Tichu is a partnered trick-taking/shedding game for four players,
              and is my favorite card game of all time. It's bit complex: it may
              take you half an hour to learn all the rules, and two or three
              hands before you really understand what's going on. But once
              you're over that, the learning curve is a real treat and the
              pacing is perfect. You can play for years and still be learning
              new strategies. Playing with the same partner (or same opponents)
              can build up a great dynamic over time.

            <em>To play Wizard, use all 60 cards. Treat the Tichu cards as Jokers.</em><br/>
            <p>
              Wizard is a fun and flexible game. Because 60 is such a composite
              number, you can play with 3, 4, 5, or 6 players. It's pretty quick
              to pick up, and brand-new folks can play alongside seasoned pros
              (they'll lose, but should still have fun). I always play with the
              "screw the dealer" rule (once you hit the fourth round, the sum of
              the bids must not equal the number of tricks).

              <em>To play Lost Cities, use all 60 cards. The fifth suit comprises the Aces, Wizards, and Tichu cards. It's labelled with Purple numbers and stars for the multipliers. The other four suits use the 2-9 for numbers and face-cards for multipliers.</em><br/>
            <p>
              Lost Cities is my favorite two-player card game (and one of my top
              two-players games of all time). In five minutes you'll understand
              the basic mechanics. In game one, you'll experience the
              tension that makes it fun. In game two, you'll realize the value
              of information. In game three, you'll realize the value
              of <em>mis</em>information.

            <em>To play No Thanks, pull out the cards with the white outlined numbers 3-35 and discard the rest. You also need some tokens; pennies work well.</em><br/>
            <p>
            No Thanks is the <em>simplest fun game</em> I know of. It can play
            3-5 players; you can completely describe the rules to someone in 3-5
            sentences, then enjoy playing for 3-5 hours. Make sure to keep the
            tokens hidden!
